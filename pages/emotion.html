          <p>
            Feeling happy is like when you have a big smile on your face and
            your heart feels super duper light and full of joy. It's when you're
            doing something you really love, like playing with your favorite
            toy, spending time with friends and family, or even enjoying yummy
            ice cream on a sunny day. Happy feelings can make you want to laugh,
            dance, and spread kindness to everyone around you!

        <section id="content-angry" class="tab-content">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Angry</h2>
          <p>
            Feeling angry is like having a big storm inside you. It's when
            something happens that makes you feel upset, frustrated, or mad. It
            might be when someone takes your toy without asking or when things
            don't go the way you want them to. Your face might get all scrunched
            up, and you might want to stomp your feet or even yell a little bit.
            Sometimes, it's tough to control, but just like a storm, it doesn't
            last forever. It's important to find ways to calm down, like taking
            deep breaths or talking about how you feel with someone you trust.

        <section id="content-scared" class="tab-content">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Scared</h2>
          <p>
            Feeling scared is like when you're watching a really spooky movie,
            and you suddenly hear a creaky noise in the dark! It's when
            something makes you feel worried or afraid. Your heart might beat
            super fast, and you might get butterflies in your tummy. It can
            happen when you're facing something new or when you imagine
            something scary. Like when there's a loud thunderstorm or when you
            think about monsters hiding in your room at night. It's okay to feel
            scared sometimes! You can feel better by hugging a stuffed animal,
            talking to someone you trust, or imagining brave superheroes
            protecting you.

        <section id="content-sorry" class="tab-content">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Sorry</h2>
          <p>
            Feeling sorry is like when you accidentally spill juice on your
            friend's favorite book or when you do something that makes someone
            else sad or upset. It's when you wish you could turn back time and
            make things better. You might feel a little bit guilty or sad
            because you didn't mean to do something wrong, but it happened
            anyway. Saying "I'm sorry" is a way to show that you care about how
            someone else feels and that you didn't mean to hurt them. It's
            important to apologize and try to make things right by being kind
            and helpful.

        <section id="content-gratitude" class="tab-content">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Gratitude</h2>
          <p>
            Feeling gratitude is like having a super special happy feeling
            inside your heart when someone does something nice for you or when
            something awesome happens. It's when you feel really, really
            thankful and happy about it! Like when a friend shares their
            favorite toy with you or when your parents make your favorite meal.
            It's a warm, fuzzy feeling that makes you want to say "thank you"
            and do something nice in return. Gratitude is about noticing and
            appreciating all the good things around you, big or small, and
            feeling really happy and thankful for them.
